# About Laravel Calendar
Welcomee! what i did
Authentication: Users will be able to create an account securely with the authentication system, log in and manage their personal information.
Calendar Create: Users will be able to view, add and delete their events. We could develop calendars for different time periods!
Workgroup Management: We created groups so that users can customize calendars among themselves. But I had to leave this to the second phase :)
# Some Technical Data
Auth: I am developed with Laravel 10.x and include Laravel Auth features.
FrontEnd: In this regard, I used Laravel's draft interface again. I am for simplicity.
